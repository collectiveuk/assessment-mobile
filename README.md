# Assessment for Onsi mobile engineers

This is the assessment for Onsi mobile engineers. It provides a dummy routing package with some gaps.

## Requirements

Install the latest version of [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

## Then what?

A test suite has already been set up. We have also added TODOs to the code where relevant. The tests are currently failing.

Run `flutter test` to run the test suite. Goal is to make the tests pass!
